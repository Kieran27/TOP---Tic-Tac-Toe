## About

This is a tic tac toe game you can play against another player!. It was built with vanilla javascript and focuses on organising the code through factory functions and the module pattern. The styling was done through Front End Mentor's tic tac toe challenge. The ability to play against an AI is currently unimplemented.

### What I Learned

This project was a further introduction on how to organise and structure your code. I used factory functions and the module pattern for this project. Nesting things such as the gameboard and the gameflow within modules and creating the players through factory functions was a great help in understanding the game flow and what to focus on and tackle the project piece by piece.

### What I would do differently

Aside from implementing some type of AI for another play option it would also be beneficial to separate the UI code from that of the game logic. This would further modularise the code and make it easier to work with and to understand.
